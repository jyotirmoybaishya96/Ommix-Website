## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You'll need the following software installed on your machine:

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or newer recommended)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/omnix-web.git
    cd omnix-web
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file by copying the example file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Then, open the `.env` file and add your Google AI API key:
    ```env
    # The port for the development server
    PORT=9002

    # Your Google AI API Key for Genkit features
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key_here
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

The application should now be running at `http://localhost:9002` (or whichever port you specified in `.env`).
